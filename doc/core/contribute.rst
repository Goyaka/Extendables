==========

You can contribute to Extendables simply by using the framework. The more people use the framework, the more bugs we'll find and squash, and the more reliable the framework will thus become. If you encounter an issue, please run the test suite (so we have as much diagnostic information as possible) and report your issue using the GitHub issue tracker.

Another way to contribute is by writing your own libraries and open-sourcing those. :ref:`Learn more about writing your own modules. <writing-a-module>`

Last but not least, contributions — bugfixes, new code or documentation — to Extendables itself are much appreciated. You can check the issue tracker on GitHub to see open issues or feature requests, or you can implement new features by forking the repository on GitHub and doing a push request once you have something you want to push back into the main repository. Read on to learn more.
