WIDGETS
- IntegerEditBox (integer widget + nudging)
- IntegerEditGroup (editbox + label, zou ik weglaten)
- SliderBox (slider with numerical feedback)
- TextComboBox (no idea what this is)
- TextComboEditBox (no idea what this is)
- DropDownDialog (easier dropdowns -- I think we already have something like this?)
- StandardListBox (no idea what this is)
- 
RECIPES
- StandardButtonGroup (adds a bunch of common buttons to the dialog, like ok and cancel)
  Is configurable. (Might go for another implementation, but the idea makes sense.)
- StandardDialog (uses StandardButtonGroup)
- TreeView (?)
