``logging``: unit testing in ExtendScript
=========================================

Logging is useful when debugging (nobody likes code interspersed with ``alert()`` statements). Logging is also beneficial in production settings â€” if something goes wrong, good logs will make it easy to know what happened and how to remedy the problem.

Extendables comes with a logging library, loosely inspired on the eponymous `Python library <http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html>`_.
