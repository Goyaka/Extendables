Learning ExtendScript
=====================

I know how to code
==================

* Simon Willison's `A re-introduction to Javascript <https://developer.mozilla.org/en/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript>`_ is a short and sweet overview of Javascript for those already familiar with programming. It also showcases some of the hidden power of Javascript, like variable arguments and closures.
* Javascript, by default, throws very little errors, much like PHP
* The ExtendScript Toolkit does catch quite a few errors before you ever run a script.
* See the best practices document.
* it might make sense to browse through Adobe's `Introduction to Scripting http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/scripting/pdfs/adobe_intro_to_scripting.pdf`_, but after that, refer to  the `Javascript Tools Guide <http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/scripting/pdfs/javascript_tools_guide.pdf>`_ And don't forget that there's a 
* get support over at the Adobe forums. The InDesign community is the most active ones: http://forums.adobe.com/community/indesign/indesign_scripting, but Photoshoppers and After Effects wizards do regularly try their hand at scripting as well.

I'm new to programming
======================

Extendables is a framework that aims to make coding in ExtendScript a friendlier experience, but it  will do little to help if you don't know some basics.

ExtendScript is Javascript with some Adobe mojo added here and there. If you're not very familiar with programming in general, you'd do well to consult a Javascript tutorial first, and learn the basics:

* object notation (`.`) and manipulating strings, arrays and objects
* creating functions and anonymous functions
* control structures, especially ``for`` loops
* conditionals (if/else) and comparisons

After that, take a look at Adobe's `Introduction to Scripting http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/scripting/pdfs/adobe_intro_to_scripting.pdf`_

Learning to script the Creative Suite through ExtendScript is not something you'll pick up in a couple of hours, but it's not rocket science either. As Adobe itself puts it:: 

    Scripting is not programming. You do not need a degree in computer science or mathematics 
    to write basic scripts that automate a wide variety of common tasks.
    Each scripting item corresponds to a tool or a palette or menu item in an Adobe application. 
    In other words, each scripting element is something you already know through your Adobe 
    expertise. If you know what youâ€™d like your Adobe applications to do, you can easily learn 
    to write scripts.
