Why use Extendables, if you're coding in InDesign?

* convenient: a lot of the functionality you're used to from Javascript 1.6+, like using .forEach() and .indexOf() on an Array
* (some) batteries included: comes with a couple of libraries out of the box that make it easy to e.g. connect with web services
* keep your sanity: logging, unit testing and namespaced imports. You know you want it.

Extendables was primarily written in order to make the open-source Pubtalk layout automation software easier to code and maintain, so it contains a lot of helpers in some areas (like XML handling) but hardly any in other areas (like drawing). Feel free to bring your own goodies to the table, though, either by making your own Extendables packages or by forking the project and adding whatever you fancy.
